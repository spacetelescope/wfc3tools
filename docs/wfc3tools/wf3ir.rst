.. _wf3ir:

Use this function to facilitate batch runs.

This routine contains all the instrumental calibration steps for
WFC3 IR channel images. The steps are:

    * DQICORR - initialize the data quality array
    * ZSIGCORR - estimate the amount of signal in the zeroth-read
    * BLEVCORR - subtract the bias level from the reference pixels
    * ZOFFCORR - subtract the zeroth read image
    * NLINCORR - correct for detector non-linear response
    * DARKCORR - subtract the dark current image
    * PHOTCORR - compute the photometric keyword values
    * UNITCORR - convert to units of count rate
    * CRCORR - fit accumulating signal and identify the cr hits
    * FLATCORR - divide by the flatfield images and apply gain conversion

The output images include the calibrated image ramp (ima file)
and the accumulated ramp image (flt file).

Only those steps with a switch value of PERFORM in the input files
will be executed, after which the switch
will be set to COMPLETE in the corresponding output files.
See `Section 3.4.4 of the WFC3 Data Handbook <https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb>`_ for more information.


Running `wf3ir` from a Python Terminal
=======================================

.. code-block:: shell

    from wfc3tools import wf3ir
    wf3ir(filename)


Displaying output from `wf3ir` in a Jupyter Notebook
----------------------------------------------------

When calling `wf3ir` from a Jupyter notebook, informational text output from the underlying `wf3ir.e` program will be passed through `print` as the calibration runs by default, and show up in the user's cell. This behavior can be customized by passing your own function as the `log_func` keyword argument to `wf3ir`. As output is read from the underlying program, the `wf3ir` Python wrapper will call `log_func` with the contents of each line. `print` is an obvious choice for a log function, but this also provides a way to connect `wf3ir` to the Python logging system by passing the `logging.debug` function or similar.

If `log_func=None` is passed, informational text output from the underlying program will be ignored, but the program's exit code will still be checked for successful completion.


Input Parameters for the Python Interface 
-----------------------------------------

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

    input : str
        Name of input files, such as

            * a single filename (``iaa012wdq_raw.fits``)
            * a Python list of filenames
            * a partial filename with wildcards (``\*raw.fits``)
            * filename of an ASN table (``\*asn.fits``)
            * an at-file (``@input``)

    output : str, default=None
        Name of the output FITS file.

    verbose : bool, optional, default=False
        If True, print verbose time stamps.

    quiet : bool, optional, default=True
        If True, print messages only to trailer file.

    log_func : func(), default=print()
        If not specified, the print function is used for logging to facilitate
        use in the Jupyter notebook.


Returns

    None
