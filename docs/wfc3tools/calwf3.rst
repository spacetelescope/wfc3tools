calwf3
******


`calwf3` is the name of the  main executable which processes data from the WFC3 instrument onboard Hubble taken with either the UVIS or IR detectors. The code automatically calls the appropriate tasks, but users may also run the tasks independently if they desire special processing for their datasets. :ref:`wf3cte`, :ref:`wf3ccd` and :ref:`wf32d` are used for processing UVIS images, while IR image processing is done with :ref:`wf3ir`. The :ref:`wf3rej` program is used for both UVIS and IR images to combine multiple exposures contained in a CR-SPLIT or REPEAT-OBS set. :num:`Figure#calflow` is the flow diagram for the UVIS pipeline as a whole, while :num:`Figure#irflow` contains the flow for the IR pipeline.


During automatic pipeline processing by the STScI archive, `Astrodrizzle` follows `calwf3`. All calibrated images are corrected for geometric distortion correction and associated sets of dithered images are combined into a single product. See the WFC3 Data Handbook for more information, or `Astrodrizzle <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/drizzlepac/>`_ .


Where to Find calwf3
====================

`calwf3` is part of HSTCAL package, which can be downloaded separately from its GIT repository in the `Spacetelescope <https://github.com/spacetelescope/hstcal>`_ area.  It is also installed along with the STScI distributed package `Astroconda <http://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ .


A detailed description of the improvements in `calwf3 v3.3`, which is more generally referred to as the UVIS2.0 update, can be found in the `February 22, 2016 issue of the STAN <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/newsletters/STAN_02_23_2016#STANIssue22-CALWF3Version3.3>`_.

The current WFC3 Data Handbook can be found at  http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentDHB/ .

Running calwf3
==============

`calwf3` can be run on a single input raw file or an asn table listing the members of an associtaion.
When processing an association, it retrieves calibration switch and reference file keyword settings from
the first image listed in the asn table. `calwf3` does not accept a user-defined list of input images on the
command line (e.g. ``*raw.fits`` to process all raw files in the current directory).

The :ref:`wf3ccd`, :ref:`wf32d`, :ref:`wf3cte` and :ref:`wf3ir` tasks on the other hand, will accept such user-defined input file lists, but they will not accept an association table( asn ) as input.


Running `calwf3` from a python terminal
-----------------------------------------

    In Python without TEAL:

    >>> from wfc3tools import calwf3
    >>> calwf3(filename)

    In Python with TEAL:

    >>> from stsci.tools import teal
    >>> from wfc3tools import calwf3
    >>> teal.teal('calwf3')

    In Pyraf:

    >>> import wfc3tools
    >>> epar calwf3


Running many files at the same time
-----------------------------------

The recommended method for running `calwf3` in batch mode is to use Python and
the `wfc3tools` package in the `Astroconda distribution <http://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ .

For example::

    from wfc3tools import calwf3
    from glob import glob

    for fits in glob('j*_raw.fits'):
        calwf3(fits)

.. note::

   When running in the notebook or from the python wrappers `calwf3()` may raise a RuntimeError if the underlying `calwf3.e` program fails with a non-zero exit code. Review the text output during the calibration call for hints as to what went wrong. Full runtime and error messages are printed to the terminal window and saved in the trailer file (.tra) for every run to help you diagnose the issue.


Displaying output from calwf3 in a Jupyter Notebook
---------------------------------------------------

When calling `calwf3` from a Jupyter notebook or from the python wrappers, informational text output from the underlying `calwf3.e` program will be passed through `print as the calibration runs by default, and show up in the user's cell. This behavior can be customized by passing your own function as the `log_func` keyword argument to `calwf3`. As output is read from the underlying program, the `calwf3` Python wrapper will call `log_func` with the contents of each line. (`print` is an obvious choice for a log function, but this also provides a way to connect `calwf3` to the Python logging system by passing the `logging.debug` function or similar.)

If log_func=None` is passed, informational text output from the underlying program will be ignored, but the program's exit code will still be checked for successful completion.


Command Line Options
--------------------

`calwf3`  can also be called directly from the OS command line:

>>> calwf3.e iaa001kaq_raw.fits [command line options]


The command line executable only accepts one file at a time, but you can use os tools like `awk` to process everything in a directory:

>>> ls *raw.fits | awk '{print "calwf3.e",$1}' | csh


The following options are available

* t: Print verbose time stamps.

* s: Save temporary files.

* v: Turn on verbose output.

* d: Turn on debug output.

* q: Turn on quiet output.

* r: Print the current software version number (with full revision information)

* --version: Print the current software version number only


Types of files used as input to calwf3
--------------------------------------

* _asn file: name of an association table
* _raw file: name of an individual, uncalibrated exposure
* _crj file: name of any sub-product from an association table

While both CR-SPLIT and REPEAT-OBS exposures from an association get combined using `calwf3`, dithered observations from an association do not.

Keyword Usage
-------------

`calwf3` processing is controlled by the values of keywords in the input image headers. Certain keywords, referred to as calibration switches, are used to control which calibration steps are performed. Reference file keywords indicate which reference files to use in the various calibration steps. Users who which to perform custom reprocessing of their data may change the values of these keywords in the _raw FITS file headers and then rerun the modified file through  `calwf3`. See the `WFC3 Data Handbook <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentDHB/wfc3_Ch25.html>`_ for a more complete description of these keywords and their values.
